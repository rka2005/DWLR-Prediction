## ⚙️ Usage

### Step 1: Load Data into MongoDB

Run the data loading script to ingest CSV files into MongoDB:

```bash
python load_data.py
```

**What it does:**
- Reads `groundwater.csv` from the `data/` folder
- Cleans and validates data (removes missing values)
- Renames columns to standardized format
- Inserts data into MongoDB in batches of 5000 records
- Shows progress with percentage completion
- Includes retry logic for failed batches

**Expected Output:**
```
2025-01-18 10:30:45,123 - INFO - Loaded groundwater.csv with 50000 records
2025-01-18 10:30:46,456 - INFO - After cleaning: 48500 records remaining
2025-01-18 10:30:47,789 - INFO - Progress: 5000/48500 records inserted (10.3%)
...
2025-01-18 10:35:12,345 - INFO - ✓ Successfully inserted all 48500 records into MongoDB
```

### Step 2: Generate Forecasts

Run the forecasting script to train models and generate predictions:

```bash
python forecast.py
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches state-wise data from MongoDB
- Validates minimum data points (10 required)
- Trains Prophet model with yearly seasonality
- Generates 5-year forecasts
- Creates high-resolution graphs with confidence intervals
- Saves predictions to `predictions/` folder
- Logs success/failure for each state

**Expected Output:**
```
2025-01-18 11:00:15,678 - INFO - Found 28 states for prediction
2025-01-18 11:00:16,123 - INFO - Processing state: Rajasthan
2025-01-18 11:00:45,789 - INFO - ✓ Graph saved for Rajasthan: predictions/Rajasthan_forecast.png
...
2025-01-18 11:15:30,456 - INFO - Summary: 27 states processed successfully, 1 failed
2025-01-18 11:15:31,789 - INFO - All graphs saved to: predictions
```

### 🌤️Forecasting Pipeline Details

1. **Data Retrieval**
   - Query MongoDB for each state's historical water levels
   - Sort by date (ascending)
   - Validate minimum 10 data points

2. **Model Training**
   - Initialize Prophet with:
     - Yearly seasonality enabled
     - Weekly/daily seasonality disabled (not relevant for groundwater)
   - Fit model on historical data

3. **Prediction**
   - Create future dates for next 5 years
   - Generate point estimates and confidence intervals
   - Extract last 5 years of predictions

4. **Visualization**
   - Plot forecast with confidence band
   - Format with professional styling
   - Save as PNG image

5. **Error Handling**
   - Skip states with insufficient data
   - Catch and log model training errors
   - Continue processing remaining states
   - Provide summary statistics

## 📉 Risk Classification

The system classifies groundwater levels into risk categories:

| Category | Threshold | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|
|🔴 EMERGENCY | < 3.0 m | Critical water level, immediate action needed |
|🟠 WARNING | 3.0 - 5.0 m | Concerning levels, monitoring required |
|🟢 SAFE | ≥ 5.0 m | Adequate groundwater availability |

**Note:** These thresholds are configurable in the `classify_risk()` function and can be customized per state based on regional characteristics.

- Verify `MONGO_URI` in `.env` file
- Check MongoDB Atlas cluster is active
- Ensure IP whitelist includes your IP address
- Test connection string in MongoDB Compass

### Issue: Insufficient Data for State
```
Warning: Not enough data for [state]
```
**Solution:**
- State has fewer than 10 records
- Check data quality in MongoDB
- May need more historical data collection

### Issue: Prophet Model Training Failed
```
Error: Model training failed
```
**Solution:**
- Ensure data has no NaN values
- Verify date column is in datetime format
- Check water level column contains numeric values

### Issue: Graph Generation Failed
```
Error: Failed to save graph for [state]
```
**Solution:**
- Verify `predictions/` directory exists
- Check disk space availability
- Ensure write permissions on directory
